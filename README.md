## Expert System in Prolog

## Expert Systems

Expert systems are artificial intelligence applications that simulate the expertise of a human expert in a specific domain. They are typically designed to solve a particular problem and can provide recommendations or assist with decision-making.

## Prolog

Prolog is a programming language used in the field of artificial intelligence and logic programming. It is based on the programming paradigm of logic programming, also known as "Programming Logic".

In Prolog, programmers define the data and facts in a database, and then create rules that operate on these facts to provide recommendations to the user. Prolog is especially popular as a language for developing expert systems, inference engines, and decision-making systems, due to its natural fit with the logic programming paradigm.
